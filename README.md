I'm not a developer or coder. I'm only here to learn, I host on Squarespace and find that they are very restrictive with there templates and navigation tools. What I need and what is a clutter free navigation for my web site. I think a drop down fly out would work best for me because I have a lot of sub nav content but as I said before I don't know how to code so in a nut shell this is just an experiment for me. What I hope to accomplish is creating a clutter free navigation system for my site and I'm hoping Ya'll will come to my rescue as I stumble through this insane world of developing and writing my own code for the sections I need for my site...Wish me Luck Ya'll LOL
